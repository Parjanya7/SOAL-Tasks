Logic:

1. Race #1 to Race #5:
> Start by racing all the 25 bulls in groups of 5.
> This way, you will have the result of 5 races, and each race will give a ranking of bulls from 1 to 5.

2. Race #6:
> Now, race the winners of each of the 5 races.
> The winner of this race is the fastest bull among all 25.

3. 
> Eliminate slower bulls: From the Race #6, you can discard the bulls that come 4th and 5th as they are not in the top 3.

4.
> The bull that comes 2nd and 3rd in Race #6 can still be the 2nd or 3rd fastest overall.
> You can also discard the bulls that came 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th in the preliminary race of the winner of Race #6, because they are slower than the fastest bull.

5. Race #7: 
> Now race the 2nd and 3rd bulls from the preliminary race of the 2nd and 3rd place bulls of Race #6, and the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th bulls from the preliminary race of the winner of Race #6. This will be 8 bulls in total, but you can race only 5 at a time, so you have to select the most probable contenders.

6.
> The 2nd and 3rd bulls from the 2nd and 3rd place bulls of Race #6 are the most probable contenders for the 2nd and 3rd fastest positions.

7.
> From Race #7, the 1st and 2nd place bulls will be the 2nd and 3rd fastest bulls overall.

Hence,
Total number of races = 7
